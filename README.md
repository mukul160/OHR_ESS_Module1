# Embedded Systems from Source

Welcome to **Embedded Systems from Source** — a hands-on, diagram-rich, and concept-first guide to mastering embedded systems through real-world thinking and bare-metal coding.

Whether you're a student, an engineer returning to the basics, or a robotics enthusiast tired of YouTube rabbit holes — this course is for you.

## What You'll Learn

- How microcontrollers actually work — not just how to use libraries
- Pointers, memory maps, and register-level control
- GPIO, timers, interrupts, and serial protocols (USART, I2C, SPI)
- The startup sequence and what happens before `main()`
- How to debug embedded systems like an engineer, not a guesser
- Toolchain pipeline: from code to binary to flash
- How to read a datasheet without your eyes glazing over
- (And eventually) how to write your own drivers

> All content is structured in **progressive modules** with annotated code examples and original diagrams.

## Assets and Diagrams

All custom diagrams and screenshots are stored in the `assets/` folder and are used throughout the course with context.

- `/assets – conceptual illustrations (registers, memory maps, toolchain)

## Getting Started

This is a read-first, code-later course. To follow along:
1. Clone the repo or view it on GitHub.
2. Open each module `.md` file in order.
3. Optional: Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for a local, interactive Markdown experience.

> Bonus: Code samples are provided in `/Module_1/CodeExamples` and written for the STM32F103 (Blue Pill).

## Credits and Licensing

- Diagrams created using Excalidraw / draw.io / Figma.
- Reference material pulled from STMicroelectronics' official datasheets.
- All original content is licensed under **MIT License** unless otherwise noted.

## Why This Exists

Too many embedded tutorials either:
- Skip the "why" and go straight to "copy this code"
- Assume you're already an EE grad with 10 years of experience

This course bridges the gap — combining **clarity, practicality, and depth** — for anyone who wants to understand embedded systems from the inside out.
